# **Website for**

# **Gentle Warrior Dojo**

**User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project**

By Kevin Ho | traderkev54@yahoo.com

**Context**

This project involves writing custom HTML5 and CSS3 code (through Bootstrap) to create a website for a Martial Arts Studio called &quot;Gentle Warrior Dojo&quot;

- Encourage the visitor to sign up for free trial classes in Karate, Judo or AikiJutsu
- Inform the visitor about the beauty and real life applications of these 3 Japanese Martial Arts
- Show how the martial arts can help one develop the calmness, courage, focus and wisdom to succeed in Life
- To showcase the Dojo&#39;s owner, Shihan Stephen Chee and his daughter, Sensei Christal Chee. A female Sensei could be a draw for female students

External user&#39;s goal: For those inquiring in the Japanese martial arts to know more and to take action

Site owner&#39;s goal: Present the benefits of the Arts and to encourage especially women and children to sign up

**Demo Version of the Website**

The website can be found in my github repository: [https://baguamaster.github.io/tgc-milestones/](https://baguamaster.github.io/tgc-milestones/)

# **Website Purpose**

The purpose of this website is to bring awareness about the Gentle Warrior Dojo and its small team of experienced instructors. The Dojo is run by an old-school Shihan (Senior Sensei) Mr Stephen Chee, who, together with this daughter and another friend, teach Karate, Judo and AikiJutsu. (Sensei is &quot;teacher&quot; in Japanese)

Each of these Japanese arts are have real world applications and 2 of them are Olympic sports, but Shihan Stephen is not techy and does not have a website. His school of about 150 students have an age group from 5 to 80 years old (!).

65% of the students are children or young people below 18 years, and the rest are largely a mix of young adults. 40% of the students are female. His daughter, Sensei Christal is an experienced martial artist and competitive fighter in her own right, and often has to conduct Ladies&#39; self defence and rape-prevention classes.

So whilst Shihan Stephen is keen to focus on the traditional aspects and beauty of the Arts, his daughter and the other Senseis focus on practical application and the day-to-day administration such as student examinations (grading) and other admin.

# **Strategic Considerations**

**Identifying External Users**

This website needs to be able to create curiosity in visitors, and to be able to clearly articulate the &quot;why should I join?&quot; question.

External users/Target audience are largely young women between 18-40 years of age, who may want to see the martial arts are not only a way to protect oneself, but a way to peaceful cultivation of mind and spirit. A way of Life, so to speak.

**Identifying External Users&#39; Goals**

The target audience needs to see that practicing martial arts can be a worthy use of time and personal development – physically, mentally and spiritually. This will obviously be weighed against the other options of joining a gym or taking fitness classes elsewhere.

Martial arts dojos are like small families in that students train and engage on a regular basis, and it is hoped that this &quot;family&quot; aspect, which promotes safety, comfort, familiarity are factors that joining a gym doesn&#39;t really have. That the dojo is a safe place to learn and grow.

**Identifying Site Owner&#39;s Goals**

The site owner, the dojo, wants to use the website to:

1. Promote awareness of the Japanese Arts
2. Raise the profile of the principal instructors
3. Encourage visitors to go for a free trial
4. Make them understand that the martials is more than just self-defence, it is for self-development

![](RackMultipart20201122-4-g9p7qy_html_ef923780b09e7eff.png)

1. **Home Page:**
  - It opens with a &quot;bang&quot;, putting 3 strong images of the 3 martial arts in a large carousel spanning the whole visual width.
  - Each carousel image has a button linking straight to a section in the website that is relevant to the subject matter.
  - Further down the carousel is a 3 column section which draws attention to 3 things with a button:
    1. &quot; **Cultivate your energy&quot;** – This portion focuses on the mental &amp; spiritual aspects of self-mastery and upon clicking the button, the visitor will be led to a static page showing the key areas of personal growth one can expect whilst as a practitioner of the martial arts.
    2. &quot; **Our Instructors&quot;** – The button leads to the &quot;About&quot; page which shows some images of the dojo and its small family, as well a brief profile of the instructors.
    3. &quot; **Urban Safety&quot;** – This button leads to a static page showing the real life applications of the martial arts.
  - Every single page in the website has a jumbotron with a link to the &quot;Contact Us&quot; page, by way of a &quot;For a free trial&quot; button. – This is the call to action.
  - Beneath the call to action is the footer with Dojo logo, tagline and icons linking to the dojo&#39;s facebook, youtube, twitter and Instagram links.

  - (NOTE: These sections easily lend themselves to expanded content and links)

1. **Judo:**

  - Similar to the Karate section, it opens with a very good youtube video demonstrating 74 Judo throws in 120 minutes. These are technical in nature and actually can serve as a syllabus of Judo techniques
  - Beneath it is copy on the Judo as well a cute gif on two toddlers doing Judo
  - The 3 column section that follows covers the history of Judo and how all modern martials using the coloured belt system came from Judo. How Judo as an Olympic sport also has practitioners in law enforcement and military.

1. **AikiJutsu:**

  - Opens with a youtube embed of a Guinness World Record attempt by a modern day Samurai. (Note: these embeds should be changed to keep content fresh)
  - The 2 column section beneath it talks about the medieval history of Jujutsu and how most Japanese martial arts came from it.

**Site Map**

![](RackMultipart20201122-4-g9p7qy_html_3ba0bdd3d89a4790.png)

**Navigation Elements**

Responsiveness and utility courtesy of Bootstrap…

**Logo**

The logo found on the navbar links to Home page [Bootstrap Component - Navbar]

**Main Navigation**

Main Navigation is a fixed position menu at the top of every web page. The 6 elements (Home, About, Karate, Judo, Aikijutsu, Contact US) are listed clearly and they are hyperlinked to their respective pages. [Bootstrap Component - Navbar]

**Collapsible Hamburger Mobile Menu**

The top navigation will be minimised into a hamburger menu when displayed in mobile screens or other small screens. Clicking on it will display the familiar 6 choices. [Bootstrap Component - Navbar]

**Carousel**

Being the largest graphical element on the home page, this changes every 3.5 seconds and has buttons that hyperlink to the relevant subject matter page. It also has &quot;prev – next&quot; arrows on both sides of the screen to aid navigation.

**Call-to-action Jumbotron**

This section features on every page and has a button offering a free trial, which is hyperlinked to the Contact Us page.

**Footer**

The footer contains the logo, tagline and the 4 social media icons: facebook, youtube, twitter, instagram

# **UX**

**Colour**

A red, black white theme is used in this instance.

Have tried blue but early UX testers thought blue to be too corporate and preferred the connotation of red as an energetic colour.

**Fonts**

Monserrat font is used throughout for the website as it is clean, not too common and has nice kerning spaces.

**Images**

Images are chosen for their powerful storytelling ability and whilst some real pictures are used, some stock images were utilized in this demo version. No doubt in the production version, some professional images will need to be shot of the dojo and the instructors.

**Copy**

Copy is written in an easy-going style, and aims to educate the reader on the uniqueness of the 3 martial arts (for they each have a unique place in martial arts history. One of them even is the progenitor of all Japanese martial arts)

**Responsiveness**

The site is meant to be responsive to many devices, from desktop and laptop screen to tablets and smart mobile phones. It can be viewed in both portrait and landscape orientation. The breakpoints are usually half of the visual range in this instance.

![](RackMultipart20201122-4-g9p7qy_html_21e3fa3f7d3105f1.png)

**Consistency of design and messaging**

All elements on the website are intentioned to carry the same look and feel. The colour scheme and design schema using curved boxes/buttons carry this through. The call to action is ever-present in every page.

**Contact Form**

The contact form in the Contact Us page is meant to facilitate either email, voice, or drop-in communications. It is deliberately kept simple.
